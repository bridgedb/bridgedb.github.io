# Development

The development of BridgeDb is as modular as BridgeDb itself. In particular, these teams exist:

1. [Java library developers](https://github.com/bridgedb/BridgeDb)
2. Creators of the identifier mapping databases
   1. [Genes and Proteins (Based on Ensembl & EnsemblGenomes)](https://github.com/bridgedb/BioMartScript)
   2. [Metabolites (Based on HMDB, ChEBI, and Wikidata)](https://github.com/bridgedb/create-bridgedb-metabolites)
   3. [Interactions (Based on Rhea)](https://github.com/bridgedb/InteractionDB)
   4. [Gene-Variant (Ensembl and dnSNP)](https://github.com/BiGCAT-UM/BridgeDbVariantDatabase)

## Development team

The following groups (in alphabetical order for groups and people) are contributing to the development of the BridgeDb world (current or past):

 * Gladstone Institutes: Alex Pico, Anders Riutta

 * University of Manchester: Christian Brenninkmeijer, Ian Dunlop, Carole Goble, Nick Juty, Stian Soiland-Reyes
 * Others: Manas Awasthi, Jianjiong Gao, Isaac Ho, Charles Tapley Hoyt, Kozo Nishida

## Funding and sustainability

BridgeDb has been funded over the years as part of many projects, including: the Open PHACTS project, OpenRiskNet,
EU-ToxRisk, NanoCommons, ELIXIR Implementation Studies MolData1 and MolData2 (2016 and 2017) and
Metabolomics (2018), and FAIRplus. Recently the project was awarded with the [NWO Open Science Fund](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/open-science/open-science-fund/open-science-fund-2021-awarded-grants) grant [203.001.121](https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/203001121).

Sustainability is further ensured by the Open Science nature and the continued dependence of other projects on
BridgeDb. Furthermore, people involved continuously push a standardized, FAIR identifier mapping database in
other data integration projects, encouraging broader sustainability.
